# TEXT-CLASSIFICATION-FOR-HUMAN-VS.-GENERATED-AND-MODEL-ATTRIBUTION-NLP-
A Natural Language processing project involving the classification of text as either human-generated or automatically generated, using a combination of pre-trained Transformers like BERT and traditional NLP machine learning models. The project consisted of two subtasks: one focused on binary classification of text (human or generated), and the other involved multiclass classification to determine the specific text generation model used.
